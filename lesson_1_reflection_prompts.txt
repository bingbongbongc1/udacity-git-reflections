How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff -u focuses on the differences so there is less info to read to catch the typo

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    can always go back to previous versions and see what you have done

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manual - less versions, you only save what you need, more control
auto - donâ€™t have to worry about forgetting to save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    git is for coding and for a program to work a collection of files is needed. files in google docs are independent of each other usually.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives you commit id, author, and the commit message
git diff of 2 commit ids will compare the 2 files and show the differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you can always reverse to the previous versions and you can troubleshoot using git checkout to look at the code at that state and see where the bug exists; use git diff between commit id with bug and without bug to compare changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    the basic javascript class needs git. i also want to use it for my dim sum app.
